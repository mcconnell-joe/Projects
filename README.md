# Projects
## This repository is designed to show several projects that display coding knowledge, ability, and understanding.

# **Solo Projects**

## **TurnBased**
### Java
TurnBased is a text-based game that I am currently working on. I am implementing all the different design patterns and principals that I have learned thus far into one cohesive project. This project is far from finished; I am adding to it all the time. I have put this here to display my ability to incorporate all the tools and ideas I have learned into a project that is coded solely by me. I hope to make it into a complete command line game soon.


## Guess My Number
### JavaScript + HTML / CSS
This JavaScript project displays a simple little game in an easy to read and intresting way. This program generates a random number(1-100) then gets the user to guess the number. Based off the user guess messages are displayed if the the guess is too high, low or not in range. This project shows a basic understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

# **School Projects**
## **Full Inheritance**
### Java
Full Inheritance is a project that I worked on in school. This program is designed to test ones ability to apply core coding principals; focusing on Polymorphism and inheritance. 

I choose to display this project on my GitHub because it shows my understanding of polymorphism, and inheritance.
It displays my coding style and shows my level of ability to incorporate a wide array of coding tools.

## **C Coding Final**
### C
I see this final as a comprehensive test of all of my C coding knowledge. Many topics were incorporated into a cohesive lab.
Tools used:
*Struct
*Dynamic arrays
*Sorting
*File utils

A key goal of the lab is to create the foundation of an object in C. C is the foundation of all programming languages, it does not strictly
have Objects but you can arrive at something similar with clever use of Struct.
