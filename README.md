# Projects

## This repository is designed to show several projects that display coding knowledge, ability, and understanding.

# **Solo Projects**

## Personal 'Personal' Website: http://www.joseph-mcconnell.com

This is my personal landing page. This website is a platform for met to host my web-based projects and show people about myself. I have stuck to vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The design process turned into something I had a lot of fun with.

## Java

### **TurnBased**

TurnBased is a text-based game that I am (was) working on. I am implementing many different design patterns and principals that I have learned thus far into one cohesive project. I have completed the battling system allowing for the user to create a hero team, they input the desired names then pick from one of three hero types. Each team consists of three heroes. The three hero types are Mage, Rouge, and Knight. Each different class has specific attack variations and abilities, the rouge can poison (25% damage for 5 turns) and back stab (higher damage, lower hit chance). The knight can stun (disable enemy from making an action for a turn) and crushing blow (same as rouge back stab). The mage can heal a target ally and can do a meteor strike (lower attack but attacks each enemy). Each hero and enemy inherit the Game Character abstract class. I have factories for heroes and enemies, enemies do not yet have abilities implemented but they do have different attack behaviors (lowest health or random enemy). There are currently three enemy types, Ogre, Orc and Skeleton. This is a project I plan on adding to up to graduation.

I have paused this project to focus on other projects.

## JavaScript + HTML / CSS -- code in personal-Website

### Guess My Number && Dice Game

These were two of my first JavaScript projects. They demonstrate basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript code integration.

### Banking Web App

This was a culmination project of my point so far in my journey as a JavaScript developer. There are a lot of different tools employed here that work together. This project employs DOM manipulation, dynamic styling, user classes among other techniques. The user must log in with correct credentials (see below) in order to access the hidden features of the banking service. From there they have access to their transactions, pulling loans, closing accounts and transferring money. There are also several timing features employed to auto log out the user and add a delay before loans are approved.

### Geo-Reach

This is an exercise location planning application. The user 'clicks' a location on the map then chooses a type of exercise (Running, Cycling or Hiking). The user then enters the different information associated with the workout and it is added to the map and workout queue. The code is organized and implement using ES6 classes. Along with the classes I have chosen to implement inheritance using ES6 classes inphase of prototype assignment. I have also used the built-in local storage implementation to store user workouts.

# **School Projects**

## **Full Inheritance**

### Java

Full Inheritance is a project that I worked on in school. This program is designed to test ones ability to apply core coding principals; focusing on Polymorphism and inheritance.

I choose to display this project on my GitHub because it shows my understanding of polymorphism, and inheritance.
It displays my coding style and shows my level of ability to incorporate a wide array of coding tools.

## **C Coding Final**

### C

I see this final as a comprehensive test of all of my C coding knowledge. Many topics were incorporated into a cohesive lab.
Tools used:
*Struct
*Dynamic arrays
*Sorting
*File utils

A key goal of the lab is to create the foundation of an object in C. C is the foundation of all programming languages, it does not strictly
have Objects but you can arrive at something similar with a Struct.
