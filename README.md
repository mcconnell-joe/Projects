# Projects
## This repository is designed to show several projects that display coding knowledge, ability, and understanding.

# **Solo Projects**

## Java
### **TurnBased**

TurnBased is a text-based game that I am currently working on. I am implementing many different design patterns and principals that I have learned thus far into one cohesive project. I have completed the battling system allowing for the user to create a hero team, they input the desired names then pick from one of three hero types. Each team consists of three heroes. The three hero types are Mage, Rouge, and Knight. Each different class has specific attack variations and abilities, the rouge can poison (25% damage for 5 turns) and back stab (higher damage, lower hit chance). The knight can stun (disable enemy from making an action for a turn) and crushing blow (same as rouge back stab). The mage can heal a target ally and can do a meteor strike (lower attack but attacks each enemy). Each hero and enemy inherit the Game Character abstract class. I have factories for heroes and enemies, enemies do not yet have abilities implemented but they do have different attack behaviors (lowest health or random enemy). There are currently three enemy types, Ogre, Orc and Skeleton. This is a project I plan on adding to up to graduation.

## JavaScript + HTML / CSS
### Guess My Number

This JavaScript project displays a simple game with a dynamic GUI. This program generates a random number (1-100) then gets the user to guess the number. The program responds to the user input and tells the user if the 'secret number' is lower or higher than the guess. This project shows ability in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. When the user guesses the correct number the GUI updates changing many elements to show in an exciting way that the user has guessed correctly. There is then a button to reset the GUI and values, it generates a new number for the user to guess. The program starts over.

### Dice Game

This is another JavaScript project focused on a simple game with a unique GUI to display the information. This is a two-player game focused on a dice roll, a random number between 1-6 is generated and the correct picture of the dice is displayed corresponding with that number. The goal is to get to 50 points, you roll the dice, anything but a one adds to your current score, if you get a one you lose all those points and it is the other user's turn. You add points to your actual total by pressing 'hold' this keeps all your current points and adds them to your total. This project also shows ability in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.




# **School Projects**
## **Full Inheritance**
### Java
Full Inheritance is a project that I worked on in school. This program is designed to test ones ability to apply core coding principals; focusing on Polymorphism and inheritance. 

I choose to display this project on my GitHub because it shows my understanding of polymorphism, and inheritance.
It displays my coding style and shows my level of ability to incorporate a wide array of coding tools.

## **C Coding Final**
### C
I see this final as a comprehensive test of all of my C coding knowledge. Many topics were incorporated into a cohesive lab.
Tools used:
*Struct
*Dynamic arrays
*Sorting
*File utils

A key goal of the lab is to create the foundation of an object in C. C is the foundation of all programming languages, it does not strictly
have Objects but you can arrive at something similar with clever use of Struct.
