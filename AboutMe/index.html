            <p class="description" id="about-me-id">
                My name is Joseph McConnell, I am a focused and dedicated Software Engineer. I am currently attending Eastern Washington University pursuing my Batchlors of Computer Science. My EWU GPA is 3.95 out of 4.0. I really enjoy coding in Java, and JavaScript but I have been introduced to many other languages. My current goal is to find a software deveolper / front end internship for the 2021 summer season. I am always working on side projects outside of school, I am always trying to imporve. Outside of projects I am also doing several Udemy courses to increase my skill base. Thank you for looking at my landing page.

        <p class="description" id="project-tb">
        TurnBased is a text-based game that I am currently working on. I am
        implementing many different design patterns and principals that I have
        learned thus far into one cohesive project. I have completed the battling
        system allowing for the user to create a hero team, they input the desired
        names then pick from one of three hero types. Each team consists of three
        heroes. The three hero types are Mage, Rouge, and Knight. Each different
        class has specific attack variations and abilities, the rouge can poison
        (25% damage for 5 turns) and back stab (higher damage, lower hit chance).
        The knight can stun (disable enemy from making an action for a turn) and
        crushing blow (same as rouge back stab). The mage can heal a target ally
        and can do a meteor strike (lower attack but attacks each enemy). Each
        hero and enemy inherit the Game Character abstract class. I have factories
        for heroes and enemies, enemies do not yet have abilities implemented but
        they do have different attack behaviors (lowest health or random enemy).
        There are currently three enemy types, Ogre, Orc and Skeleton. This is a
        project I plan on adding to up to graduation.

        </h3>
        <p class="description" id="project-guess">
        This JavaScript project displays a simple game with a dynamic GUI. This
        program generates a random number (1-100) then gets the user to guess the
        number. The program responds to the user input and tells the user if the
        'secret number' is lower or higher than the guess. This project shows
        ability in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. When the user guesses the correct
        number the GUI updates changing many elements to show in an exciting way
        that the user has guessed correctly. There is then a button to reset the
        GUI and values, it generates a new number for the user to guess. The
        program starts over.

        <p class="description" id="project-dice">
        This is another JavaScript project focused on a simple game with a unique
        GUI to display the information. This is a two-player game focused on a
        dice roll, a random number between 1-6 is generated and the correct
        picture of the dice is displayed corresponding with that number. The goal
        is to get to 50 points, you roll the dice, anything but a one adds to your
        current score, if you get a one you lose all those points and it is the
        other user's turn. You add points to your actual total by pressing 'hold'
        this keeps all your current points and adds them to your total. This
        project also shows ability in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
